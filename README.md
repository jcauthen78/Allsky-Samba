# Allsky-Samba
A simple shell script to install SAMBA & configure shares on the Raspberry Pi.

The intent is to create a network accessible folder to the main folder of my AllSky (https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky) via my MacOS laptop. The shares are accessible via Windows as well - although not as simply as MacOS.

The code should be fairly intuitive, and it has been tested on Raspberry Zero 2W, RPI3 and RPI4's.

Use at your own risk - while I have successfully tested this on my many personal Raspberry PI systems, I am not a professional coder and I can't foresee every potential problem that may occur. There may be easier ways to accomplish what this script does, but this is what works for me and is something I run on every fresh Raspbian install without any hesitation.
